# Notes

This is implemented in the most hacky, yet simple way possible; by
overwriting Roll20's CSS with my own. It's liable to break at any time.

It also only does fairly basic things, just to make Roll20 a slightly
more atmospheric place to spend 4-6 hours running from innocent slimy
monsters, hauling forbidden knowledge back to civilization.

The graphics used were created by me from free image resources and icon
